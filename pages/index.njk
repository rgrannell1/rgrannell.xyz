# rgrannell.xyz

Hi, I'm [Róisín](https://www.nameshouts.com/names/all-languages/pronounce-roisin) (she/her)

Professionally I'm a Site-Reliability Engineer for a distressingly large website. In my free time I [write a lot of code](https://github.com/rgrannell1/), [take photos](https://photos.rgrannell.xyz/), read as much as I can manage, and play piano badly.
