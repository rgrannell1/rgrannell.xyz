# Experiments With GTP-J-6B

GPT-J-6B is ["a 6 billion parameter, autoregressive text generation model trained on The Pile"](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax). I don't have any legitimate uses for it, for let's have some fun! I'm going to generate some text by:

- Feeding a title to GPT
- Capturing the funniest output, and feeding some of it back (with context) to GTP to generate more content

Let's create a treatise on the worm, since worms are inherently funny animals.

**The Humble Worm; Friend, Foe, or Folly?**

<blockquote>
All change into one another,</br>
and do not walk like men;</br>
but I, I that am a worm,</br>
I can change myself into man</br>
and a man into an angel,</br>
and call the angel an angel again.</br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
If there is a wolf at our gate,</br>
we shall not fear the wolf:</br>
and if the wolfs and the birds</br>
should eat us, they should eat us</br>
for there is no difference</br>
between us and them.</br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I, I that am a worm,<br/>
am older than the beasts:<br/>
they see me, but they do not know me;<br/>
they call my name,<br/>
but they do not say my true name;<br/>
if they did, they would know my power.<br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The worms that walk on the earth<br/>
cannot know the secrets of the sea,<br/>
nor the secrets of the angel that speak with God;<br/>
they never hear the voice of the angel<br/>
but go on, without turning.<br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Now have the worms come<br/>
and the angels gone,<br/>
and you and I must come;<br/>
there is no time to wait,<br/>
but every hour that comes is too late.<br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Now have the waves come</br>
and all men's words come,</br>
but they cannot hold the waves back:</br>
the words are swift as the waters.</br>
The most shining stars are only fixed light</br>
</blockquote>

**INTRODUCTION.**

The works of nature present us with two interesting views of the future condition of the larger worms.

1. On the one hand, the process of reproduction is every where becoming more rapid; and that without any tendency whatever to give them more than the same proportion of life they now possess.

2. But the farmers, alas! are in some instances too wise or too cruel. They let the helpless creature live out its miserable span, and, knowing
that its carrion days are past, seize upon it as soon as it becomes
universally known that it is even imperilled, and sell it for so much as
they can obtain.

Many thousands of large earth worms, co-operators in the earth, and hundreds of smaller ones, file across the dry beds of the shallow waters of the desert. They are large earth worms, like large earth worms. They are 1-1/2 to 2 inches long and do look like earth worms. They also have a worm like section of their body, which makes them look much like earth worms. But, they are not earth worms. Not even close.

But they are earthworms. Big earthworms. **A lot of earthworms.**

I was surprised that GTP generated a coherent poem; it stuck with a theme without getting too distracted. Some lines were beautiful;

> The most shining stars are only fixed light

and some were on par with ["The Tay Bridge Disaster"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tay_Bridge_Disaster).

> and if the wolfs and the birds<br/>
> should eat us, they should eat us

Otherwise I don't have much to say, I think "The Humble Worm; Friend, Foe, or Folly" speaks for itself. Enjoy!

## Addendum, October 2024

The internet is now mostly AI slop of comparable quality to the above. The novelty of LLMs and other GenAI wore off quickly, and while they are <a href="https://www.404media.co/email/1cdf7620-2e2f-4450-9cd9-e041f4f0c27f/">occasionally funny</a> they are never actually good. They are also hideously expensive to run, environmentally destructive, and seemingly not very profitable. But hey, Github Copilot is useful.
